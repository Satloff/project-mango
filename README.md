# project-mango
Independent project to develop a rules-based software that derives consumer trends based on social media postings, especially those containing images.

# Instagram Scrape:
This small portion of project-mango is actually a driving force. Run by a 15 min cronjob, the most recent images uploaded to instagram are categorized and saved for pre-processing. 

This is built in concert with AWS.

# Not Public:
The remainder of project-mango is unavailable to the public, due to the nature of the project, algorithms, and trading schemes. 

For more information, please reach out to me.
